"8ecb663a-c4d5-4351-9b9c-40f724ff936d","Bats are the most common source of rabies in humans in North and South America, Western Europe, and Australia. In the United States, there were 19 cases of human rabies from 1997–2006, 17 of which were attributed to bats.[27] In North America, about half of human rabies instances are cryptic, meaning that the patient has no known bite history.[24] While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols, studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions. These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, ""investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission"".[28] It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite.[24] Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment, for example. Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin. Rabies virus has also been transmitted when an infected human unknowingly dies of rabies, and their organs are transplanted to others.[28]","5e5e08d8-ac06-440b-9018-f4f747fbcc37","03eb3e50-d4d8-4261-a60b-fa5aee5deb4a","41","35","8ecb663a-c4d5-4351-9b9c-40f724ff936d","MedicalCondition","rabies","null","2020-03-20T23:54:54.433000Z","1","5e5e08d8-ac06-440b-9018-f4f747fbcc37","Ashpat123","exploration"

"5d1621d3-b877-4747-aceb-ecf807a6c9ec","Bacterial vaginosis is caused by bacteria that change the vaginal microbiota caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that crowd out the Lactobacilli species that maintain healthy vaginal microbial populations.\nOther non-bacterial vaginal infections include: yeast infection (candidiasis), Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis).[8][9]\nBacterial meningitis is a bacterial inflammation of the meninges, that is, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.\nBacterial pneumonia is a bacterial infection of the lungs.\nUrinary tract infection is predominantly caused by bacteria. Symptoms include the strong and frequent sensation or urge to urinate, pain during urination, and urine that is cloudy.[10] The main causal agent is Escherichia coli. Urine is typically sterile but contains a variety of salts, and waste products.[11] Bacteria can ascend into the bladder or kidney and causing cystitis and nephritis.\nBacterial gastroenteritis is caused by enteric, pathogenic bacteria. These pathogenic species are usually distinct from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal gut flora. But a different strain of the same species may be pathogenic. The distinction is sometimes difficult as in the case of Escherichia.\nBacterial skin infections include:\nImpetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly seen in children.[12] It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes.[13]\nErysipelas is an acute streptococcus bacterial infection[14] of the deeper skin layers that spreads via with lymphatic system.\nCellulitis is a diffuse inflammation[15] of connective tissue with severe inflammation of dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin. Cellulitis can be caused by normal skin flora or by contagious contact, and usually occurs through open skin, cuts, blisters, cracks in the skin, insect bites, animal bites, burns, surgical wounds, intravenous drug injection, or sites of intravenous catheter insertion. In most cases it is the skin on the face or lower legs that is affected, though cellulitis can occur in other tissues.","0233a4cf-af5d-4d04-8766-13f68ca93ad5","03eb3e50-d4d8-4261-a60b-fa5aee5deb4a","282","271","5d1621d3-b877-4747-aceb-ecf807a6c9ec","MedicalCondition","candidiasis","null","2020-03-18T10:11:11.309000Z","1","0233a4cf-af5d-4d04-8766-13f68ca93ad5","Ashpat123","exploration"

The most common bacterial disease is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which affects about 2 million people mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, and Hansen's disease. They typically range between 1 and 5 micrometers in length.","01aefd8a-185f-4fc4-9c7d-040a333b757d","03eb3e50-d4d8-4261-a60b-fa5aee5deb4a","667","659","d4fdcd57-5120-4a82-945a-1dd4b7e41204","MedicalCondition","syphilis","null","2020-03-18T07:07:32.565000Z","1","01aefd8a-185f-4fc4-9c7d-040a333b757d","Ashpat123","exploration"

"36b0f922-ff49-405d-b4ef-95ab07955c95","Much like viral pathogens, infection by certain bacterial pathogens can be prevented via vaccines.[30] Vaccines against bacterial pathogens include the anthrax vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine. Many other bacterial pathogens lack vaccines as a preventive measure, but infection by these bacteria can often be treated or prevented with antibiotics. Common antibiotics include amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline. Each antibiotic has different bacteria that it is effective against and has different mechanisms to kill that bacteria. For example, doxycycline inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria which leads to the death of the affected bacteria.[35]","3fa56b25-415b-402f-86d3-755c5c4a3c5a","c06bd022-6ded-44a5-8d90-f17685bb85a1","390","379","36b0f922-ff49-405d-b4ef-95ab07955c95","Medicine","amoxicillin","null","2020-03-18T07:05:11.283000Z","1","3fa56b25-415b-402f-86d3-755c5c4a3c5a","Ashpat123","exploration"

"556d082e-4879-4ad4-aec9-e7d438eabb9a","Some antidepressants are used as a treatment for social anxiety disorder, but their efficacy is not entirely convincing, as only a small proportion of antidepressants showed some efficacy for this condition. Paroxetine was the first drug to be FDA-approved for this disorder. Its efficacy is considered beneficial, although not everyone responds favorably to the drug. Sertraline and fluvoxamine extended release were later approved for it as well, while escitalopram is used off-label with acceptable efficacy. However, there isn't enough evidence to support citalopram for treating social phobia, and fluoxetine was no better than placebo in clinical trials. SSRIs are used as a first-line treatment for social anxiety, but they don't work for everyone. One alternative would be venlafaxine, which is a SNRI. It showed benefits for social phobia in five clinical trials against placebo, while the other SNRIs are not considered particularly useful for this disorder as many of them didn't undergo testing for it. As of now, it is unclear if duloxetine and desvenlafaxine can provide benefits for social anxiety sufferers. However, another class of antidepressants called MAOIs are considered effective for social anxiety, but they come with many unwanted side effects and are rarely used. Phenelzine was shown to be a good treatment option, but its use is limited by dietary restrictions. Moclobemide is a RIMA and showed mixed results but still got approval in some European countries for social anxiety disorder. TCA antidepressants, such as clomipramine and imipramine, are not considered effective for this anxiety disorder in particular. This leaves out SSRIs such as paroxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine CR as acceptable and tolerated treatment options for this disorder.[19][20]","08d1d5f9-d78e-4b4e-8277-261fc315431f","c06bd022-6ded-44a5-8d90-f17685bb85a1","395","384","556d082e-4879-4ad4-aec9-e7d438eabb9a","Medicine","fluvoxamine","null","2020-03-18T06:56:51.429000Z","1","08d1d5f9-d78e-4b4e-8277-261fc315431f","Ashpat123","exploration"

Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome.[151] There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.[152]","518463c5-630d-4577-9a5a-d02c3dce5110","03eb3e50-d4d8-4261-a60b-fa5aee5deb4a","536","518","ba9a4480-1386-4c4c-b3ee-c9fbb40efe48","MedicalCondition","multiple sclerosis","null","2020-03-17T23:49:00.649000Z","1","518463c5-630d-4577-9a5a-d02c3dce5110","Ashpat123","exploration"
